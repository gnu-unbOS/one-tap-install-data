  source: 
    # Add any Deb822 sources.list(5) keys you want to add. Note that a
    # Signed-By: key is added automatically; if you add one explicitly,
    # it will be ignored and overridden.
    # 
    # The special value <SUITE> will be replaced by the suite the user
    # is running; it can appear in any of the below keys.
    #
    # The special value <COMPONENTS> will be replaced by the
    # (space-separated) components (as listed in the "components:" top
    # level key), after filtering by the policies which the user has
    # enabled. It can occur in any of the below keys; but it will
    # probably not work well unless used in the "Components:" key.
    Types: deb deb-src
    URIs: https://deb.example.com/debian/
    Suites: <SUITE>
    Components: <COMPONENTS>
    Architectures: amd64 i386
    # If there are differences in this section on a per-suite basis that can't
    # be expressed by way of <SUITE>, you can add per-suite keys; e.g.,
    # suite-buster-Architectures: amd64 i386
    # creates a line "Architectures:" in the .sources file, but *only* on buster.

  # Update the list below by the list of Debian codenames which you support
  suites:
  - bullseye
  - bookworm

  # List all the components your repository supports. If there is only
  # one, or they all have the same license policy, it's fine to drop the
  # "components" and "policies" keys and hardcode the component(s) in
  # the "Components:" key of the "source" key above. In that case,
  # however, the "policy" key is required (see below).
  components:
  - main
  - alternate
  - alternate-nonfree

  # For every component above, there should be an entry in the
  # "policies" key that states the policy for that repository.
  #
  # The values here should be one of:
  # - "main": only contains DFSG-free software that may only
  # (build-)depend on DFSG-free software.
  # - "contrib": only contains DFSG-free software. However, it may
  # (build-)depend on software which is not DFSG-free.
  # - "non-free": all other repositories.
  policies:
    main: main
    alternate: main
    alternate-nonfree: non-free

  # If there is no "components" key, drop the "policies" one and add a
  # "policy" key instead:
  #policy: main
